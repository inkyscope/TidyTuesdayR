# datavizRscope
a personal take for data integrity by repeating, reinforcing, continuing, and refining constantly

Dear contributors on #Tidy Tuesday[:link:](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TidyTuesday&src=hashtag_click) by R for Data Science [:link:](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)

Since June, I started focusing on my latent interest in R data visualization. In particular, a live screen cast on YOUTUBE by David Robinson has brought me to explore different(!) data(beyond iris and mtcars data). I found myself tremendously lucky when I was introduced to lots of new packages in R and methods such as lasso regression on text. As well, it was intriguing and amazing when he pans out the process to draw insights through a various approach on data. However, when it comes to transplanting those processes on my own rstudio, it has been extremely overwhelming to dive into R language, which reminds me of period when I was grappling with English and German.

At the beginning, it was devastating to juggle all the necessary elements at once to figure out  algorithms, data structures and relevant packages to tidy up and visualize accordingly. In the meantime, the live, impromptu screen cast delivered regularly by David Robinson(@drob)[:link:]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dr4qw8o0nYU) has encouraged me to withstand that frustration and move through it. He initiates what he wants to look for and tackle with his accidental mistakes in the process of tidying data and go through it persistently, finally detect and fix it in a timely manner; double check, triple check, try to find why it doesn't work, what he did wrong, how to fix it, sometimes just divert another way blatantly...

On top of it, what keeps my interest steady to catch up with uploads on #TidyTuesday is that some of dedicated contributors (@jakekaupp, @geokaramanis, @committedtotape, @christi58451746, @cnicault, @watzoever...) encompass such an essential attitude on paying an exhaustive attention to details followed by demanding quality work. It enlightens me on what to look for and what I'm hoping to accomplish and how I am going to do it. It compells me to stay motivated and keep on moving forward. 

After around 3 months(summer time!) from the relentless cycles of imitation and repetition, my self confidence has been steadily increasing to delve into various approaches on data analysis. Whereas it is apparent that my plots are not enough to capture what data is to be revealed, my passion on data wrangling is getting richer than I anticipated. I have reflected on the by far the most rewarding experiences when boosting willingness to put in the extra effort to create an equivalent or alteration for what I am looking at.

I'd like to thank you from the core of my heart to contributors to make #Tidy Tuesday get going exuberantly. You have been a rich source of inspiration throughout this year and I am looking forward to returning the favor by joining the part of #TidyTuesday community soon. It would not have been possible without your generous share.
